# Photosynthesis

The project is about creating a digital boardgame from an already existing boardgame. In this case the boardgame will be Photosynthesis, as the game has some different components and has many different challanges to work with. At the same time the game does not have any moving pieces, but takes use of the board in a different way. The game has also been chosen because it still needs some strategy to play, and that makes it perfect to trains an intresting AI.
